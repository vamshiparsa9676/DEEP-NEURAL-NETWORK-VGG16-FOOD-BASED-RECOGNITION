# DEEP-NEURAL-NETWORK-VGG16-FOOD-BASED-RECOGNITION
Developed a food recognition system using Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and the VGG16 architecture in Python, leveraging the power of deep learning for image classification tasks. The project involved training the VGG16 model on a food dataset for accurate identification of food calories,fats and carbohydrates from inages.
